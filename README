Long ago I considered making a phone system using Asterisk and AGI
scripts which would be targeted at groups of people trying to organize
and who did not have reliable internet access. The system includes
new user registration including referral codes, private voicemail
between users, public bulletin board-style conversation,
along with public and private teleconferencing using Asterisk's meetme
module.
